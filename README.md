This project is an exploration and implementation of the fundamental concepts behind Large Language Models (LLMs), like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), built entirely from scratch. The primary goal is not just to use libraries, but to deeply understand the core architecture, mathematics, and design principles that make them work.

This project is heavily inspired by **Andrej Karpathy's** "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" series.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Transformer Architecture from Scratch:** Core components like Multi-Head Self-Attention, Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks, and Layer Normalization are implemented using Python and PyTorch.
- **Text Generation:** Once trained, the model can generate new text based on a given prompt.
- **Custom Tokenizer:** A simple, character-level tokenizer has been implemented.
- **Training Pipeline:** A complete training loop for data loading, model training, and loss calculation.
- **Inference Script:** A separate script to generate text from a pre-trained model.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The model's core is based on the [Transformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). It specifically utilizes a decoder-only stack, similar to GPT models.



The main components are:
1.  **Token Embedding:** Converts input characters/words into dense vectors.
2.  **Positional Encoding:** Adds information about the position of tokens in the sequence.
3.  **Transformer Blocks:** These are the main building blocks of the model, which include:
    - **Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention:** Allows each token in the sequence to focus on previous tokens (by masking future tokens).
    - **Feed-Forward Network:** A simple neural network applied to the attention output.
4.  **Final Linear + Softmax Layer:** Generates the probability distribution for the next token.

## Usage

**(This section will be updated as development progresses)**

#### Training the Model

To train the model, run the `train.py` script:
```sh
python train.py --dataset_path='path/to/your/textfile.txt'
```

#### Generating Text

Once the model is trained, use the `generate.py` script to generate text:
```sh
python generate.py --prompt="Hello world"
```
